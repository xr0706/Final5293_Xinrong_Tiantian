# Introduction

In this project, we investigate the robustness of model explanations across three dimensions: randomness in model training, size of training data, and consistency between model-agnostic explanations and inherently interpretable models. We use Random Forest and Logistic Regression to test these three aspects, and the process is structured in a 12 steps:
